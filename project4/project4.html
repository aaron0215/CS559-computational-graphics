    <h1> Description </h1>

    <p>
    In case you don't know, many people have no idea they are just sleeping. Sometimes dream is so real that people think it's reality. <br><br>

  </p> <p>
    The movie "Inception" has a decent disscussion about what dream is, but many silly people just think it is fictional! <br> <br>
    In the movie, totems are used to determine whether you are in a dream or not. <br> <br>

    Do you want to test your "reality"? I have made two totems for you. After 5 seconds, you should see the spinning top falls down and you get a "3" on the die. Otherwise, time to wake up!

    <h1> Implementing comments </h1>
    <p>
    The model looks very simple. However, it turns out very complicated to implement, in terms the limitation of "Painter's Algorithm" and using shaders. <br>Especially to write the correct shader, the order to draw triangles matters. It's a pain to figure out the right way to draw each triangle.
    </p>


    <ul>
    I have used some tricks in the implementation:
    <li>Use different "encoders" to compute the distance of each triangle in their space. </li>
    <li>Add dummy z-values to make circles floating on the sirface, even though they are actually "in" the surface.
    <li>Give a flag to each triangle to tell which space it is in.</li>
    <li>Use hierarchy model to dynamically add circles onto the die</li>
    <li>Use an arc "track" to shoot light, to simulate the day time.</li>
  </ul>
